# Jordan Scrapes FSU's bookstore

This package scrapes books, their prices, and type from [Florida State Univerity's bookstore](https://www.bkstr.com/floridastatestore/shop/textbooks-and-course-materials). 

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run `npm i`. 

I am using Luminati for my proxy in this code. If you would like to use Luminati, you'll need to get credentials from [Luminati.io](https://luminati.io/?affiliate=ref_5f240848c7669177abf8ef2a) and rename `.sample.env` file to `.env` and place your credentials there.

After that, you just need to run `npm start`.
